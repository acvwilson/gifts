Watercolor (American English) or watercolour (Commonwealth and Ireland), also aquarelle from French, is a painting method. A watercolor is the medium or the resulting artwork in which thepaints are made of pigments suspended in a water-soluble vehicle. The traditional and most common support for watercolor paintings is paper; other supports include papyrus, bark papers, plastics, vellum or leather, fabric, wood, and canvas. Watercolors are usually transparent, and appear luminous because the pigments are laid down in a relatively pure form with few fillers obscuring the pigment colors. Watercolor can also be made opaque by adding Chinese white. In East Asia, watercolor painting with inks is referred to as brush painting or scroll painting. InChinese, Korean, and Japanese painting it has been the dominant medium, often in monochrome black or browns. India, Ethiopia and other countries also have long traditions. Fingerpainting with watercolor paints originated in China.

### Fun Facts:

* Albrecht Durer (1471-1528) is considered the earliest master of the medium
* Paints consist of four ingredients: pigments, a binder to hold the pigment in suspension, additives, and solvent to thin or dilute.
* Modern watercolors use water soluble complex carbohydrates as the binder, but in the 16th to 18th centuries sugars or hide glues were used as the binder.
* There are no white watercolors; white in paintings is usually areas of the paper showing through.
* Water color pencils and water color pastels are available to draw fine details and then blend them with water to soften.
* The difficulty in painting with water colors is anticipating the behavior of water rather than attempting to control it.
