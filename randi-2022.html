            <p>
              <strong>The mission of Planned Parenthood is:</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>to provide comprehensive reproductive and complementary health care services in settings which preserve and protect the essential privacy and rights of each individual</li>
              <li>to advocate public policies which guarantee these rights and ensure access to such services</li>
              <li>to provide educational programs which enhance understanding of individual and societal implications of human sexuality</li>
              <li>to promote research and the advancement of technology in reproductive health care and encourage understanding of their inherent bioethical, behavioral, and social implications</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Planned Parenthood Southeast believes in the fundamental right of each individual, throughout our service area, to manage his or her fertility, regardless of the individual's income, marital status, race, ethnicity, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, age, religion, disability, or residence. We believe that respect and value for diversity in all aspects of our organization are essential to our well-being. We believe that reproductive self-determination must be voluntary and preserve the individual's right to privacy. We further believe that such self-determination will contribute to an enhancement of the quality of life and strong family relationships.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Atlanta, Georgia affiliate of Planned Parenthood began in 1964. In 1930, a Planned Parenthood affiliate was created in Birmingham, Alabama, the oldest in the Southeast. Services were added in Mississippi in 1989 and all three states joined forces in 2010 under the name Planned Parenthood Southeast.
